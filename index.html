            <h1>What is ADSTOCALL?</h1>
			<p>ADSTOCALL is the ultimate platform for passive income for mobile users. It’s an interactive platform where users, advertisers and mobile network providers can engage with one another on a single ecosystem.
				It’s an interactive digital ad platform which acts as a passive income source for users. The main objective is to make the digital ad experience more seamless, profitable and accessible for all stakeholders. 
			</p>
				<h1>How ADSTOCALL Works?</h1>
				<p>
					The overall process is simple and straightforward. ADSTOCALL offers 02 (two) convenient options for advertisers:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Auditions 
						</li>
						<li>
							Digital billboards
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Auditions can be best described as a “caller tune” or “voice ad” where advertisers can promote their market offerings. These auditions will be set with the contact numbers of our registered users. An advertiser can also publish their ads on digital billboards published on the homepage of ADSTOCALL
					On the other hand, users can subscribe to ads and their contact numbers will be used to broadcast the auditions according to their subscriptions.
					This leaves us with the mobile network operator who can collaborate with ADSTOCALL to connect users and advertisers.
					Both the users and mobile network operators will receive a percentage for each audition received from the advertiser.
					</p>
